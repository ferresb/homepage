My PhD researches were then directed by Frédéric Rousseau and supervised by Olivier Muller, between 2018 and 2022, in the SLS team at TIMA lab. We aimed at using the emerging paradigm of Hardware Construction Languages to build a flexible exploration methodology, and provided a PoC framework based on Chisel, as well as an applicative benchmark.",
